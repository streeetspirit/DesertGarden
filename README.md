# DesertGarden

Unity game, clone of Plants vs. Zombies
Created as a project while studying Complete Unity Game Developer Course on Udemy by Ben Tristem

Rules:

Player needs to defend the right border of the desert from ghosts, golems, and other nasty creatures.

Time that player has to survive is fixed for every level.

Choose a defender from the top right pane and  place it on a desert field. The field is a grid. Expect defenders to snap to it.

Every defender has its cost. At the beginning of each level player has some amount of money. To generate money place a Star defender on a field.

Defenders:

Gennie - simplest defender, medium enemy resistance

Star Trophy - generates money. The cheapest one, low enemy resistance

Dragon - high enemy resistance

Gravestone - can throw bones into enemies, medium resistance

Flying enemies can jump over the gravestone (but not thrown bones)


Have fun!
There are only three levels, don't give up!
